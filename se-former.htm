				<h2>Objectif</h2>
				<p>
					LeThis workshop involves dance practices that focus on care and
					pleasure in the body. Working with intentions – such as ‘move as a
					practice of care for your body’ and ‘follow the thread of pleasure’ –
					this relaxed and welcoming workshop will involve gentle prompts from
					which to explore your own movement. Movement is improvised in response
					to the invitations or prompts.

				</p>
				<p>
					The practices shared in this workshop have been developed by the
					artist in response to living with chronic pain and her research into
					what it means to dance with pain. She has developed ways of
					approaching choreography in response to the questions: What does it
					mean to collaborate creatively with pain? How can we work creatively
					with our bodies as they are? What kinds of movement emerge when the
					intention is to care for your body? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Sarah Hopfinger will present Pain and I at Festival Quartiers Danses
					on 6th September, which involves choreographies developed from these
					practices of care and pleasure. More information on Pain and I here:
